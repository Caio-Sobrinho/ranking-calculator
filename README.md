# ranking-calculator
*This is programming logic study material*  

I created a function that receives as a parameter the number of wins and losses of a player, After that, return the result to a variable, the balance of Ranked must be done through the calculation (wins - losses)

The challenge:

If wins are less than 10 = Iron;
If wins are between 11 and 20 = Bronze;
If wins are between 21 and 50 = Silver;
If wins are between 51 and 80 = Gold;
If wins are between 81 and 90 = Diamond;
If wins are between 91 and 100 = Legendary;
If wins are greater than or equal to 101 = Immortal.

## Exit

At the end, a message should be displayed:
"The Hero has a balance of **{saldoVitorias}** and is at the level of **{level}**"

I used the following techniques:

- Variables
- Operators
- Repeat loops
- Decision structures
- Functions
